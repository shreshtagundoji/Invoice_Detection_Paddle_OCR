# PaddleOCR-InvoiceDetection

### Scope of the Project Project Title
Automated Receipt Detection Using Neural Networks and PaddleOCR

### The Application
The application aims to develop an automated system for detecting and extracting information from receipts using PaddleOCR. The system will streamline the process of handling receipts by accurately identifying and extracting key details such as receipt number, date, total amount, and vendor information from scanned or digital receipts.
Benefits of this solution? This solution will benefit businesses, accounting departments, and financial institutions that handle a large volume of receipts. Automating the receipt pro- cessing will reduce manual effort, minimize errors, and increase efficiency in financial operations.

### State of the Art Existing Solutions
Several solutions have been developed to address the problem of receipt detection and data extraction. Notable ones include:
• Tesseract OCR - An open-source OCR engine that has been used in various applications for text extraction.
• Google Cloud Vision API - A cloud-based solution that provides powerful OCR ca- pabilities for detecting and extracting text from images.

### Differentiation from Current State of the Art
While existing solutions typically rely on off-the-shelf OCR engines or pretrained models, our approach involves building neural networks from scratch tailored for receipt-specific text detec- tion and information extraction. Additionally, we will customizing the models to the structured format of receipts and incorporating advanced techniques, such as YOLOv9 for object detec- tion and PaddleOCR for text recognition, we aim to achieve higher accuracy and efficiency in extracting key information like receipt numbers, dates, total amounts, and vendor details. This approach ensures a more robust and tailored solution for automated receipt analysis compared to general-purpose OCR solutions.
